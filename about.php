                prelature
                of the Catholic Church, founded in 1928 by Spanish priest, St. Josemaria Esciva. It has over
                90,000
                members, a large majority of whom are lay men and women, the others being priests. Opus Dei
                members
                strive to live out their Christian faith fully in their life and work â€” they strive to be saints
                through
                their ordinary life.
                Other aspects of the spirituality of Opus Dei are divine filiation (awareness of being a child
                of
                God
                and acting accordingly), ordinary life (finding God in everyday things), charity and apostolate
                (like
                the early Christians, giving witness to their faith and helping others to know Christ), love for
                freedom
                (in anything that is not a matter of faith each person makes their own decisions and takes
                responsibility for them), prayer and sacrifice (trying to have a constant dialogue with God and
                being
                ready to put their interests and those of others before their own) and unity of life (trying to
                live
                their faith in every aspect of their life) (FAQs, opusdei.org).
